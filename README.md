## Overview
The "Journey Like a Genius" backend is built using Ruby on Rails. This API handles saving users itineraries generated by the frontend. The backend communicates with the frontend to ensure seamless interaction and personalized user experiences.

## Features
- **Data Storage:** The backend integrates with a database to manage and retrieve user data and historical suggestions.
- **Responsive & Scalable:** The API is designed to handle multiple requests efficiently, providing quick responses to the frontend.

## Getting Started
To get a local copy of the backend project up and running, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Crosswolfv1/journey_like_a_genius.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd journey_like_a_genius

3. install dependencies:
   ```bash
   bundle install
   
4. Start Rails server:
   ```bash
   rails s
  
This will run the backend server locally. Make sure the frontend is pointing to the correct local API endpoint (e.g., http://localhost:3000).
The backend API will now be available for testing and development.
