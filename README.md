## Overview
The "Journey Like a Genius" backend is built using [insert backend stack here, e.g., Express, Node.js, Ruby on Rails, etc.]. This API handles user preferences, manages the itinerary generation logic, and delivers curated recommendations for dining and activities based on the user's input. The backend communicates with the frontend to ensure seamless interaction and personalized user experiences.

## Features
- **API Endpoints for Preferences:** Receive and store user input such as group size, budget, and city.
- **Recommendation Logic:** Use algorithms to generate recommendations for dining and activities.
- **Data Storage:** The backend integrates with a database to manage and retrieve user data, preferences, and historical suggestions.
- **Authentication:** (If applicable) Secure login and session management for users.
- **Responsive & Scalable:** The API is designed to handle multiple requests efficiently, providing quick responses to the frontend.

## Getting Started
To get a local copy of the backend project up and running, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Crosswolfv1/journey_like_a_genius_be.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd journey_like_a_genius_be

3. install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install

4. Start dev server:
   ```bash
   npm start
  
This will run the backend server locally. Make sure the frontend is pointing to the correct local API endpoint (e.g., http://localhost:5000).
The backend API will now be available for testing and development.
